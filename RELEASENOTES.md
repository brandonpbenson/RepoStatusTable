Version 0.6 introduces table order options

## New features 

### Sorting

Repos in the table can now be sorted either alphabetically or according to their last modification.
Ascending as well as descending can be set as options.

### Only show changed

New option "OnlyShowChanged" allows to only print repos that have either a changed Git status or a HEAD that ponts to a branch that is not default. 
Default branches are configurable.
